Onewire Extension Card for OpenKNX REG1 BASE Device https://openknx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OpenKNX/pages/7667822/OpenKNX+REG1+Basismodul (But you need the Case of the Universal Extension Version)
<br>
The Extension Card is no official created OpenKNX Hardware, so the usage is your personal risk. 
<br>
But it runs now since several days inside my person lab without any issues.
